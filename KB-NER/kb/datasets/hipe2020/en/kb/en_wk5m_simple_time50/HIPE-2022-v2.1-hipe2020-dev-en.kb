Q:	John Brisben Walker discusses several of these questions in an analysis of postal conditions pre¬ pared for the American Newspa¬ per Publishers’ Association, in which he says in part: “The average express haul to¬ day is less than thirty-eight miles. This is because trade is largely carried on with those living near by. “If the government carried par¬ cels at even one cent a pound it would get the hundreds of mil¬ lions of packages sent out by the great, dry-goods houses. This would probably reduce ‘the aver¬ age haul’ to twenty miles or less. “The United States Govern¬ ment is already equipped with more than 60,000 completely or¬ ganized stations. These have their managers and clerks, their ren¬ tals. heat, and light, their detec¬ tive and legal services already paid for. To handle parcels would cost nothing additional in tens of thousands of post offices except the wagon haul in the lo¬ cality. . . putting all into one class and ac¬ cepting packages up to 200 pounds weight.” “The government is spending more than $32,000,000 annually on a country delivery service, which the Postmaster General re¬ ports as carrying only 25 pounds per trip per wagon.
