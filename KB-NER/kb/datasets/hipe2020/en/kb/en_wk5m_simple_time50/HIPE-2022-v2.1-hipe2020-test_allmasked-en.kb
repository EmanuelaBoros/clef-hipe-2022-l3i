Q:	Bui it was just so much hokum, in the opinion of a representative ol the District Supervisor's office. If Edentonians fooled themselves Into believing that Edcnton's population is ever the 4.000 mark, they didn't succeed in fooling anyone else. When a person or a family moves to a town, the name is placed in the car¬ rier's bock. But. when they leave town, their names are not struck off the boc!;. Go everyone who moved to Edcnton from 1920 to 1930 was ugislucd in the postofTice carriers lyckx, and the names of everyone v,ho moved from Edenton in that ■ ■pried of time were not removed from the bocks. Edentonians even wonted to in- ' elude in the Edenton census count the names of all Edentonians 'work¬ ing away from Edenton, but they were reminded that such a practice was not condoned by Uncle Gam. So the official census of Edenton for the next decade will be 3,519. Eden- tonians’ protests to the conti aiy notwithstanding.
