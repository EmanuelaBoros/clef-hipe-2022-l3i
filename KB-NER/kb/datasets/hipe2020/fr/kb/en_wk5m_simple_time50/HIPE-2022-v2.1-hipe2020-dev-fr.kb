Q:	Olano s'est également emparé de la première place du classement général au terme de ce contre-la-montre qui n'a guère réussi aux Suisses, le meilleur d'entre eux, Alex Zulle, concédant 2'24 ". Dans le nord de l'île de Majorque, la tâche des coureurs a été rendue plus ardue par un vent violent de la mer, ce qui explique la moyenne relativement basse du vainqueur Olano (50,291 km / h). Ces conditions qui désavantageaient les petits gabarits n'ont toutefois pas faussé la lutte entre les meilleurs. Olano a été en tête de bout en bout et son large succès ne souffre aucune contestation, Alors que l'Allemand Uwe Peschel, de la petite équipe espagnole Estepona-Brcpac confirmait ses grandes qualités de rouleur en se classant troisième après avoir longtemps détenu le meilleur temps, le rapport des forces au niveau des rouleurs s'est inversé. Les Suisses ont été les grands battus et les Espagnols les principaux vainqueurs. Si la victoire d'Olano et, dans une moindre mesure la seconde place de Melchior Mauri ne peuvent être considérées comme de grandes surprises, les écarts concédés par Alex Zulle, l'un des maîtres de la spécialité, et Laurent Dufaux, qui a terminé à plus de cinq minutes, sont p lutôt inquiétants. Escartin en embuscade Cette étape contre la montre a sensiblement redistribué les cartes. Outre Olano et Mauri, deux coureurs ont tout lieu d'être particulièrement satisfaits de leur performance, Lance Armstrong et Fernando Escartin. En n'abandonnant que l' 30 " à Olano, superbe d'aisance et d'efficacité, l'Américain, champion du monde en 1993 à Oslo devant Miguel Indurain, a confirmé son extraordinaire retour en condition.

Q:	La National Zeiturtg écrit à ce propos : « L'initiative des députés romands du Conseil national éveillera un joyeux écho dans tout le pays, car une limitation des pleins pouvoirs extraordinaires du Conseil fédéral s'impose absolument en raison des nombreuses conséquences insupportables qu'As ont entraînées. Il serait injuste d'imputer ces conséquences fâcheuses aux membres du Conseil fédéral : elles sont Inséparables du système pratiqué depuis 1914. Cest avec ce système qu'il faut rompre. H faut reconnaître aussi que certains départements de l'administration fédérale ne prêtent guère le flanc à la critique, oar ils ont fait un. usage très judicieux des pleins pouvoirs et no s'en sont servi qiiej dans des cas vraiment urgents.
